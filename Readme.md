: Security and Data Protection
Along with the password protection and any using any firewall. We must have a backend solution to the protection of data where the system must call out the user asking for deletion; updating; or location settings.
It is noticed that while a person is working on a current project, they tend to save sensitive information on desktop for easy access but as the work is done the saved data is not moved or deleted from there. So, we must create 3 folders namely:
-	Personal: where we can’t command anything only it has to be password protected
-	Temporary: It’s a folder which deletes the stuff saved in it within the set expiry date and time, so the employee is relaxed about the stress of failure of protection.
-	Permanent:
o	Permanent Important: the files stored here will reside here until the user wishes with password protection
o	Permanent Public: the files stored here as the user wishes but easy access where it’s not important for having a password
After formation of these folder the tendency of the employees to store things directly in desktop will not end hence:  when they save the file in desktop a pop up will show sharing the copy of file created in temporary folder with 7 days expiry period. There will expiry of each new file created in desktop of 7 days too, in that much time the person will have to store it in the correct folder otherwise they will lose data.
This might sound a hard work but this practise will increase the security to the data.
Next milestone to security: to keep a check always with who all have the access in several levels like scheduled check over existing accesses and the new access asked by employees.
